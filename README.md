## Overview
This repository contains the first public release of *The Theory of Persistence* (TOP), a framework for understanding stability, adaptability, and coherence across physical, social, and computational systems.  
It unifies several conceptual models â€” including relational dynamics, entropy/ossification balance, and process-orientation â€” into a coherent structure capable of explaining and predicting persistence across domains.

---

## Purpose
The intent of this publication is to make the framework freely available for research, peer review, and applied testing.  
Readers are encouraged to explore its applications, reproduce the analyses, and engage in further development **with proper attribution**.
